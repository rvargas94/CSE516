# Final project for Intro to Machine Learning

This repository contains the final project for my undergraduate machine learning course at CSUSB.  Although naive implementation, I believe this was great undergraduate 'exploratory' work.

In the Project folder, the ```Project.ipynb``` jupyter notebook contains all code and results, as well as some description of the implementation and purpose of the code cells. The original data is there, which is also divided into testing and training sets.
